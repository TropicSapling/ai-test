# ai-test
An artificial intelligence that tries to jump over the obstacles at the right time. It comes up with conditions that are tested, and when true it will jump. Here are some of the greatest conditions it has come up with:
* objy >= objx - y
* objy >= objx <= (objdy && (93 - speed - objx / 9))
